Hi!

I am Julien, an engineer and PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html). I am working at the laboratory for timber constructions [IBOIS](https://ibois.epfl.ch) since 2016 and I am also part of the National Centre of Competence in Research for Digital Fabrication [NCCR dfab](http://www.dfab.ch) since November 2017.

I am a passionate scientist specialized in timber engineering and I want to share my knowledge and experience to create a sustainable built environment for our future. My atypical path and practical experience in timber industry has guided me through research to explore the wide range of possibilities in wood construction. My expertise is also focused on the integration of new technologies within the AEC Industry because it will disrupt the way we think and build.

Moreover, I am very curious and I stay informed about society, policy and global context in which we are evolving. Therefore, I stay open to new challenges outside of my primary competences as long as there are interesting problems to solve and a motivated team.

So, please feel free to contact me for additional information about my work or if you have interesting ideas you want to share.
