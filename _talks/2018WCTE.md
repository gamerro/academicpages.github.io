WCTE is the world's premier forum for presenting and discussing the latest technical and architectural developments and innovations in wood or timber construction. WCTE is the most prestigious international event in timber engineering, engineered wood products and design of timber structures, which is held biennially in different parts of the world and attracts researchers, engineers and architects, code consultants and building officials, contractors and project managers, fabricators and suppliers from all continents. During WCTE 2018 the traditional focus on timber engineering and material science will be complemented by architecture related topics such as evaluation methods for green buildings and by an own platform for computer-based methods for modelling, parametric design, production, etc.
