A man who wants to act for the future cannot ignore two major facts. Firstly, the resources that made possible the transformation of today's world will be rarefied especially fossil energies. Secondly, these resources will contribute until their profitable depletion to the phenomenon of global warming because of their CO2 emissions. The vision of a near future is therefore not "development" with an idea of growth but sustainable reorganization. It will consist of storing CO2 by any means, limiting the CO2 emitted to achieve it, while transforming our environment to no longer need to emit: in short decarbonize our world. Actually, to create this world the energy that can be consumed is the sixth of what our parents had.

A colossal challenge awaits the construction field with the current population level. It will be necessary to deconstruct the less efficient structures, to build where it has been deconstructed by densifying the housing and to adapt today's buildings where it is possible. To make a successful transition, five reorganization areas should be implemented: one sociological and four technological.
