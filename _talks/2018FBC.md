In this talk, I present the new innovative timber structure of the Vidy theatre. The construction of Vidy theater pavilion, designed in the IBOIS (Laboratory of Timber Constructions of EPFL) provides the implementation of unprecedented support structure exclusively made of wood panels. Its double folded plate structure holds its mechanical performance from the rigidity of the joints. The panels are joined by innovative wood-wood connections.
