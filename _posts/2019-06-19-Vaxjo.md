I had the chance to visit a special wooden structure of 6 stories during the [CompWood 2019 conference](https://gamerro.github.io/talks/2019CompWood) in VÃ¤xjÃ¶, Sweden. It is an exemplary structure because of the use of wood materials for a mid-rise height building but above all for its construction phase which is done under indoor conditions thanks to a lightweight metal structure covered with membranes and including two cranes. This type of covering structures for the construction phase are reused for other building sites and allow perfect conditions for the workers and the different timber engineered materials used.

The city of VÃ¤xjÃ¶ is dedicated to sustainability and as a result to use more sustainable material like WOOD. The European Commission has appointed VÃ¤xjÃ¶ the European Green Leaf Award 2018 (greenest city in Europe). This small city should inspired us all in Europe to move forward for timber construction and a consistent vision for sustainability in the AEC industry.
