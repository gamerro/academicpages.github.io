The French magazine *Vosges Mag* has honored me with an article dedicated to my career until my arrival at [EPFL, IBOIS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/). It highlights the excellent school [ENSTIB](http://www.enstib.univ-lorraine.fr/en/) present in eastern France where I was trained as a Timber Engineer.
