title: "Rotational mechanical behaviour of wood-wood connections with application to double-layered folded timber-plate structure"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/VidyRotational
excerpt: 'This paper is focused on the structural design of an innovative wood-wood connection designed for a full-scale double-layered timber folded-plate structure: the new Vidy theatre pavilion (Lausanne, Switzerland). Investigations into the potential of these new connections have been ongoing since 2010 in the Laboratory for Timber Constructions (IBOIS) at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). As a continuation of this research line, the mechanical characterization of the Vidy pavilion connections in rotation was performed using different engineered wood panels. This research was realized in order to help the Bureau d'Etudes Weinand to understand the rotational behaviour of such connections for the real project. This experimental work was conducted in two parts: one focused on single-layered joint and the other on double-layered one. The key findings of the paper show that Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels have strong qualities for rotational applications and the double-layered connections have a high rotational resistance. Finally, the connection is able to resist the maximum moment of the project considering this type of engineered timber panels.'
