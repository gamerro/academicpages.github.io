During my last year of engineering school, I worked on the mechanical characterization of a new timber frame concept developed by the company [PopUp House](https://www.popup-house.com). My job was to assess the concept under lateral loads like wind. An experimental campaign was performed at the [National School of Wood Technologies and Industries](http://www.enstib.univ-lorraine.fr/en/) in order to improve and guide this new concept to the construction market.
