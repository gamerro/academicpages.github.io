I participated in the structural design of a full-scale double-layered timber folded-plate structure: the Vidy theatre pavilion (Lausanne, Switzerland). It is the first implementation of a full-scale building with an origami shape using only wood-wood connections for a span of 20 meters. It was a very challenging and complex project.
