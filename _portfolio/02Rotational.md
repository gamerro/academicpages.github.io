I assisted Dr. St√©phane Roche in his thesis research entitled *Semi-Rigid Moment-Resisting Behavior of Multiple Tab-and-Slot Joint for Freeform Timber Plate Structures*. Our collaboration was presented at the World Conference on Timber Engineering 2016 held in Vienna. This work was focused on the characterization of the semi-rigidity of wood-wood connections for timber plate structures. Experimental investigations and new analytical models were developed to be able
