Master Thesis 01

**University:** École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)

**Student University:** École Nationale Supérieure de Techniques Avancées (ENSTA Paris Tech)

**Dates:** May to August 2017

**Student:** Ingebrigt Lemaître

**Abstract:** Thanks to the rise of new technologies and constant progress in fields such as robotics, new ways of designing timber structural building elements can be imagined and implemented on an industrial scale. Complex methods and sequences of assembly can be set up quickly, allowing for the machining of complex shapes fitted to each individual project’s requirements. This report is focused on the mechanical characterization of a prefabricated roof part entirely made out of Oriented Strand Board (OSB) panels, machined with a fully robotized line. Furthermore, for cost, time and ecological reasons, the assembly of the parts was chosen to avoid traditional gluebased bonding processes. Instead, the prefabricated elements will be held together with wood-wood OSB Integral Mechanical Attachments (IMAs) connections. Experimental tests and numerical models have been developed to determine the mechanical response of such structural elements.
