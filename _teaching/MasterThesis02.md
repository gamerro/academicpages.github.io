**Title:** Numerical Model of a Timber Tab-and-Slot Joint

**Student:** Vincent Lestang

**University:** École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)

**Dates:** Falls Semester 2018-2019

**Abstract:** The structures under study at IBOIS are mainly based on timber panels connected by MTSJ. Their design using Finite Element Models (FEM) requires to know on the one hand, the behavior of the panels and on the other hand, the stiffness of their connection. In the models, the semi-rigidity of the joints is input as springs, meaning that a displacement in a certain direction is allowed regarding the force or the rotation applied in this direction. The model developed by Roche permits to determine the rotational stiffness, but the model determining the shear stiffness is missing. The development of such model could permit to achieve the entire design of a structure using mainly FEM.

**Credits ECTS:** 4
